* What new skills have you learned?
I've learned how to copy basic web pages. Learned how to do a footnote and straight line.

  * What has been easy?
  Putting the page together has been easy. Html is very simple.

  * What has been difficult?
  The HR tag. The line across the page. It was so difficult I still do not have
  the exact line as the original page. So many ways to style it and I know I still did not get it right.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  Yes, this project was much faster because it used the same logic.
